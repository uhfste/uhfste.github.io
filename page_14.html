<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#800000;">Potential causes of pica in sheep:</span></h1>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">- Nutrient deficiencies - Sheep lacking certain minerals such as phosphorus, sodium, copper, and iron may start consuming non-food items trying to obtain these nutrients.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">- Boredom and stress - Sheep without enough mental stimulation or under anxiety may start chewing on or eating odd things. Providing enrichment with toys, brushes, and human interaction could help with boredom and stress.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">- Parasites - Worms, liver flukes, coccidia and other parasites can irritate the gut causing discomfort leading sheep to eat unusual items to self-medicate. Regular deworming and clean housing helps prevent parasites.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">- Toxic exposure - Ingesting contaminants like lead, arsenic, mercury from feed, bedding or soil could contribute to pica. Testing surroundings for toxins is advisable.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">- Diet imbalance - Too much of certain minerals such as sodium and calcium in the diet may prompt pica behavior. Evaluating mineral levels in feed is recommended.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">- Oral injury - Mouth or tooth damage can cause pain and potentially lead to pica. Regular dental checkups and care may help.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">- Disease - Illnesses like rabies, scrapie and neurological conditions could be linked to pica starting suddenly. Veterinary assessment is recommended if this occurs.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">- Genetic tendency - Some sheep may be prone to pica inherently. Removing them from breeding stock could decrease this.</span></h3>
