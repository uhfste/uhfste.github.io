<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#800000;">Caseous Lymphadenitis</span></h1>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">**<span style="color:#008080;">Signs of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) in ovines**</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">* **External CLA:** The most common clinical sign is the presence of firm, painless abscesses in the peripheral lymph nodes, such as the submandibular, parotid, prescapular, and prefemoral nodes. The abscesses may be single or multiple, and they may vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. Over time, the abscesses may rupture and discharge a thick, greenish-yellow pus.<br />
* **Internal CLA:** Internal CLA is more difficult to diagnose clinically, but common signs include weight loss, ill thrift, and chronic respiratory problems, such as cough and nasal discharge.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">**Postmortem findings of CLA in ovines**</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">* **External CLA:** The affected lymph nodes are enlarged and contain a thick, greenish-yellow caseous material. The abscesses may be surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule.<br />
* **Internal CLA:** Abscesses may be found in the internal lymph nodes, such as the mediastinal and retropharyngeal nodes, as well as in the lungs, liver, and other organs.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">In some cases, CLA can be fatal, especially if the internal organs are involved.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">**Treatment of CLA**</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">There is no specific treatment for CLA. Treatment is usually supportive and includes drainage of abscesses and antibiotics. In severe cases, euthanasia may be necessary.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">**Prevention of CLA**</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">The best way to prevent CLA is to vaccinate lambs and kids at a young age. There are also a number of management practices that can help to reduce the risk of CLA, such as avoiding overcrowding and providing clean and dry housing.</span></h3>
