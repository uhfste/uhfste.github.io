<span style="color:#008080;"><span style="font-size:28px;">Antibiotics</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><span style="font-size:20px;">It is essential to complete the entire antibiotic course. Administer antibiotics for a minimum of five days, even if the symptoms resolve. Prematurely discontinuing antibiotics often leads to a relapse or the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Continue treatment for 30 hours after the animal no longer exhibits symptoms.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><span style="font-size:20px;">Note on Antibiotics: It should not be viewed as a universal remedy for all medical issues. Using antibiotics as a first response to any apparent health problem can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, it is crucial to reserve their use for treating infections as intended. Additionally, it&#39;s important to be aware that antibiotics can place significant stress on the immune system and have adverse effects on the digestive system.</span></span></p>
