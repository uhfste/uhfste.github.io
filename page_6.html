<h2>&nbsp; <span style="color:#B22222;">In ovines (sheep), a retained placenta, often referred to as retained fetal membranes (RFM), is a condition when the placenta or afterbirth is not removed from the uterus within the typical timeframe following lambing or kidding. The placenta should typically be discharged within a few hours and a day following delivery. When it stays within the sheep for a long time, it can cause a number of health problems and consequences. Retained placenta in ovines can be treated as follow :</span></h2>

<h4><span style="color:#800080;">1. **Monitor the Ewe:** Keep a close eye on the ewe that has retained the placenta. Signs of retained placenta include a portion of the placenta visibly hanging from the vulva, foul-smelling discharge, and signs of discomfort or illness in the ewe.</span></h4>

<h4><span style="color:#800080;">2. **Wait for Natural Expulsion:** In some cases, the placenta may eventually be expelled naturally within a few days. If the ewe is otherwise healthy and not showing signs of illness, you can wait and monitor her condition.</span></h4>

<h4><span style="color:#800080;">3. **Consult a Veterinarian:** If the placenta is not expelled within a day or two, or if the ewe shows signs of illness, it&#39;s essential to consult a veterinarian. Retained placenta can lead to uterine infections (metritis), which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.</span></h4>

<h4><span style="color:#800080;">4. **Medical Treatment:** The veterinarian may administer oxytocin or other medications to help stimulate uterine contractions and facilitate the expulsion of the placenta. Antibiotics may also be prescribed to prevent or treat any uterine infections.</span></h4>

<h4><span style="color:#800080;">5. **Manual Removal:** In severe cases, the veterinarian may need to manually remove the retained placenta. This procedure should only be performed by a trained professional, as it carries risks of injury to both the ewe and the person performing the procedure.</span></h4>

<h4><span style="color:#800080;">6. **Supportive Care:** Provide the ewe with supportive care, including proper nutrition, clean and dry bedding, and a stress-free environment to aid in her recovery.</span></h4>

<h4><span style="color:#800080;">7. **Prevention:** To reduce the risk of retained placenta in the future, ensure the ewe receives proper prenatal care, including vaccinations and nutrition. Adequate nutrition throughout pregnancy can help reduce the likelihood of placental retention. Additionally, minimizing stress during lambing or kidding can also be beneficial.</span></h4>
